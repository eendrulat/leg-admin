## Features
* Includes two main pages: simple search page (leg-search.html) and main map interface (leg-districts.html)
* Simple search page contains a single line address search bar. Passes address to leg-districts.html
* Main legislative district page will focus on the appropriate legislative district by parameters passed through the URL: 1) from the leg-search page (?addr=), 2) for a specific district, e.g. Congressional district 5 (?dist=5&disttype=c), or 3) a latitude and longitude (?longitude=-123&latitude=45)
* Main legislative district page also allows searching by address, or interactively selecting districts from the map.

## Project Details

* ArcGIS Javascript API, v. 3.4
* Application was developed by Scott Moore (Esri), Erik Endrulat (Oregon GEO), and Bill Sweeny (OR LegAdmin)
